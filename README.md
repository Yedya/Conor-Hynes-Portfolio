## Welcome


I am a driven person who loves to learn about new technologies and software practices. I am never satisfied with a project until I know it has been completed to the best of my abilities.I can be a strong member of a team, often stepping up to lead if there is a need for it. I'm passionate about game development and I enjoy seeing people getting enjoyment out of the games I make!


## Game Projects

Developed during my internship at Corona Labs, demonstrating new SDK features.
The player is driving a mobile bitcoin miner and has to collect bitcoins and avoid structures and obstacles.
-There are many mechanics in the current build.I have done all the artwork in photoshop.
-I have tested this game on many devices(iOS & Android)and spent a great deal of time optimizing the game to ensure it runs between 60-55 FPS on most devices.
